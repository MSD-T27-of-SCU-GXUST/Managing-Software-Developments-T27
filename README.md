# Managing-Software-Developments-T27
This is just assessment for the course on Managing Software Development. So do not use all of this code please!

This project is about how to arrange students with similar interests, personalities, and daily routines in the same dormitory as much as possible based on the information they fill in about their interests, hobbies, personality tendencies, and learning goals. I hope that this system can help students find their friends better, reduce possible disputes and conflicts, and reduce the school's dormitory management costs.
